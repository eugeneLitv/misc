# Sharing Project Settings
# (see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/synchronizing-and-sharing-settings.html)
#
# For sharing project settings, .idea project configuration directory
# should be shared via version control.
#
# Directory based project format (.idea directory)
# is used by all the recent IntelliJ IDEA versions by default.
# Here is what you need to share:
#
# All the files under .idea directory in the project root,
# except the workspace.xml and tasks.xml files, which store user-specific settings.
**/.idea/**/workspace.xml
**/.idea/**/tasks.xml

# Be careful about sharing the following:

# Android artifacts that produce a signed build (will contain keystore passwords)
# dataSources.ids, datasources.xml (can contain database passwords)
dataSources.ids
datasources.xml

#You may consider not to share the following:
# gradle.xml.
# XML files under .idea/libraries in case they are generated from Gradle project.
# user dictionaries folder (to avoid conflicts if another developer has the same name).
gradle.xml

# For the legacy project format (.ipr/.iml/.iws files)
# don't share the .iws file, since it stores user specific settings.
*.iws
